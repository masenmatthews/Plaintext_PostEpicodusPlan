# Post-Epicodus Plan
### By Masen Matthews

#### Top priorities (coding specific)
  * Create a fully polished portfolio with 4-6 well made, fully functional products.
  * Host these portfolio pieces on my personal site, which needs to be visually enticing and fully built out. All projects will need to be deployed to Heroku so that they can be directly linked.
  * Purchase a domain name so that I can host my website.
  * Get significantly better at styling and move my coding emphasis more towards front end. I plan to do this by combing through YouTube tutorials, reading articles, and utilizing some of the lessons on Learn How to Program. I'm also going to look into purchasing some books that can help with this.
  * Learn React using Learn How to Program, YouTube, books, and other online resources
  * Go back to Angular and get better at that through practice

#### Other coding priorities
  * Learn Python using YouTube, top-rated books, and other online resources
  * Phase out portfolio projects that were made at Epicodus to make room for original content.
  * Contribute to open source projects
  * Find nonprofits and community organizations that I can do pro bono work for
  * Sharpen up my README-writing skills so that I can have the best documentation in the Pacific Northwest

#### Job search / networking / technical interview priorities
  * Attend 2-3+ Meetups per week while job hunting
  * Attend Mentorship Saturdays at Metal Toad every month
  * Continue to host 1 Portland Future Leaders In Tech Meetup per month
  * Do at least 60 - 90 minutes of technical interview prep per day using CodeWars and other online resources.
  * Apply for at least one job per day (ideally 2-3)
  * Create a spreadsheet of jobs that have been applied for. This will include dates of when I applied for them, contact numbers to follow up, date of last contact, etc.
  * Set up at least 1-2 coffee meetings per month with people who are employed at companies that I'm interested in

#### Wellness priorities outside of coding and job hunting
##### ...because being a functional, healthy human being makes you better in all areas of life
  * Do yoga at least 2-3 times per week
  * Run and/or lift weights 2-3 times per week
  * Sleep for 7-8 hours per night
  * Don't let myself fall into the habit of waking up later than 8 AM on weekdays (hopefully this doesn't become a reach priority)
  * Stop eating doughnuts on a daily basis
  * Limit alcohol consumption
